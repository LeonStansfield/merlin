# Merlin

Merlin is a 2D game enging/framework made by Leon Stansfield.
It is designed for use in small game jams and creative coding and as a fun hobby project to introduce me to c++ and engine development.
It is created using raylib as a base, to handle rendering, window managment and input managment.
